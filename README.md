## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mbabazii/PraisonAI.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd PraisonAI
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Quick Start

To get started quickly, you can run the example provided in the `examples` folder. Navigate to the folder and execute the following command:

```bash
python example.py
```

This will demonstrate how to set up a basic multi-agent system.

## Usage

PraisonAI allows you to create agents for various tasks. Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate how to define an agent.

### Creating an Agent

You can define an agent by creating a new class that inherits from the base agent class. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```python
from praisonai import Agent

class MyAgent(Agent):
    def perform_task(self, task):
        # Your task logic here
        return f"Task {task} completed!"
```

### Running Agents

Once you define your agents, you can run them in a multi-agent system:

```python
from praisonai import MultiAgentSystem

system = MultiAgentSystem()
agent1 = MyAgent(name="Agent1")
agent2 = MyAgent(name="Agent2")

system.add_agent(agent1)
system.add_agent(agent2)

system.run()
```

### Collaboration Between Agents

PraisonAI allows agents to communicate with each other. Hereâ€™s how you can implement collaboration:

```python
class CollaborativeAgent(Agent):
    def communicate(self, message):
        # Logic for communication
        return f"Received message: {message}"

agent1 = CollaborativeAgent(name="Agent1")
agent2 = CollaborativeAgent(name="Agent2")

response = agent1.communicate("Hello from Agent1!")
print(response)
```
